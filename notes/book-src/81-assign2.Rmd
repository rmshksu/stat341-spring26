Set the seed to "73" (`set.seed(73)`).

1. Define 3 scalars:

\[
a = 3
\qquad\qquad
b = 5
\qquad\qquad
c = 0.25
\]

2. Define 3 vectors:

\[
\boldsymbol{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 3 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix}
\qquad\qquad
\boldsymbol{y} = \begin{bmatrix} 11.3 \\ 8.97 \\ 9.82 \end{bmatrix}
\qquad\qquad
\boldsymbol{z} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{bmatrix}
\]

3. Generate 3 standard normal values and save them to a variable named w.

4. Multiply w by a random uniform value bound between 1 and 5, then save it as the new w.

5. Define the matrix:

\[
\textbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{x} + w_1 \\ \boldsymbol{y} + w_2 \\ \boldsymbol{z} + w_3 \end{bmatrix}
\]

6. Confirm the following is true:

\[
\textbf{AA}^{-1} = \textbf{I}
\]

7. Add a row of 3 gamma distributed values with shape equal to 2 and rate equal to 1/5.

8. Simulate 4 normally distributed data points with a mean equal to the trace of A and standard deviation of 5. Save them as a variable named q.

9. Add a column of 1s to the matrix A and define:

\[
\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}} = (\boldsymbol{A}^\prime \boldsymbol{A})^{-1} \boldsymbol{A}^\prime \boldsymbol{q}
\]

10. Calculate the predicted values of q:

\[
\hat{\boldsymbol{q}} = \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{\hat{\theta}}
\]

11. Calculate the confidence interval for the mean of $\boldsymbol{q}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{q}}$. 

12. Simulate 1000 normally distributed data points with the same mean and standard deviation as in question (8). Plot them on a histogram. Include vertical lines for the lower and upper bound on the mean of $\boldsymbol{q}$.
