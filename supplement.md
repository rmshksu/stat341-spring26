I'll try to fill this more throughout the semester as needed. None of this content is required or even necessarily recommended, but it can be very helpful if you want to dive deeper with your project.

If you were to choose any piece to jump into, I'd recommend any of the 3Blue1Brown videos.

3Blue1Brown is a youtuber who makes math education videos (very, very good ones). Below are links to some of his courses that are helpful for those wanting a better intuition on the math we're using:

- [Essence of linear algebra](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=cp-JwJEOjRUFdcZZ)

- [Essence of calculus](https://youtu.be/WUvTyaaNkzM?si=iR8SaGjhw6mr2eOm)

- Well outside the skillset needed for this course, but very entertaining none-the-less [The R Inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf)

**Statistics related**
