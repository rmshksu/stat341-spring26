## About

This course serves as an introduction to applied statistical modeling for the biological sciences. Major topics include: regression analysis, uncertainty quantification, chi-square testing, and analysis of variance. We will cover more complex topics like generalized linear models and mixed models if time permits.

**Main Goal of this Course:**  
The main goal of this course is to introduce students to statistical modeling, present data from both observational studies and designed experiments, write out the corresponding statistical model and fit it to the data using R software.  

**Course topics**:  Regression analysis, analysis of variance, model inference, and prediction.


**Prerequisites**: STAT 240

## Software  
Course material and examples will be provided in R. However, students may use other programming languages with instructor approval.

## Attendance  
Attendance to lectures and in-class participation are expected. Failing to attend class will lower your grade.

## Homeworks
Homework will be due on week 1, and every other week until week 7. Incorrect assignments may be resubmitted once for full points. After that, assignments may be resubmitted for 80% of their last point worth. Late submissions will be considered for 80% of the original points.

## Journals
Journals will be due every friday until week 8. Students will be asked to write 2-3 sentences about their experience in class that week, responding to the prompts below:

- What's something you've learned this week?

- What's something (concept/topic/example) you struggled with this week?

- Is there anything else you'd like me to know?

## Final project  
Semester projects may deal with any topic that interests the student and is approved by the instructor. Projects are expected to identify a research problem, acquire data related to that research problem, analyze the data using basic summary methods, propose a statistical model to further explore the research problem in the context of the data, fit the model to data and provide a write-up as well as a presentation covering the results.

## Grading
The course will be for 3 credits, graded on an A-F scale. A (>90%), B (90%-80%), C (80%-70%), D (70%-60%), and F (<60%). Final grade will be based on the following criteria:

| Item            | Percentage |
|-----------------|------------|
| Homeworks       | 20%        |
| Journals        | 16%        |
| Checkpoints     | 14%        |
| Final Report    | 20%        |
| Presentation    | 20%        |
| Code + Tutorial | 10%        |
| Total           | 100%       |


## General Policies

### Generative AI policy  
Students may use generative AI tools as an assistant to complete their homework or projects but are required to understand every step of their work. Failure to justify their own work may reduce the student’s grade.

### Academic Honesty  

Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor System (www.ksu.edu/honor). The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time students enrolled. A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty.

### Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities  

Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their instructor.  Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety.  If you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center at accesscenter@k-state.edu, 785-532-6441.


### Expectations for Classroom Conduct  

All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Government Association By Laws, Article VI, Section 3, number 2. Students that engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class.


### Copyright Notification  

During this course, students are prohibited from selling notes to or being paid for taking notes by any person or commercial firm, or posting lecture notes on any websites without the express written permission of the professor teaching this course.
